ApTreX,Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 6 February 2022,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it."
debarghyo chaudhuri,Review after 1 week of usage,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 July 2022,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone."
Pankaj Sangwan,Best product,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 February 2023,I am a regular user of iPhone since iPhone 5s launched. Currently i have an 14pro. I bought this phone to gift someone. There is no need to review an iPhone if you are a regular user. WE CAN'T COMPARE AN IPHONE WITH ANDROID.
Aman Pratap,I own this for gaming but its just become show off thing because of battery life!,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 February 2023,"Camera quality is better, battery life is very decent if you play games on it like Call of Duty it will not last long, but games runs so smoothly! Screen size is small, face id works perfect, No bugs! Display quality is best, All i want to say is spending this much money and getting least things is not worth, but its apple😂 (we shell not talk about worth of money)"
Sameer adhate,A great phone,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 January 2023,"Everything is good with this phone like camera(highly impressive video quality), battery life(normal use-more than 10hrs,Gaming-4-5hrs), performance(best). But con for me is it takes 1and half hour to charge(good factor-it takes 30mins for 50percent charge). Other than that a great phone for normal use and for gaming.writing this after 6months usage."

Rakesh,One word “excellent“,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 21 January 2023,"If you are an android user, trust me switch to iPhone. It will never let you down. For heavy user battery easily last more than 1 day. Camera is awesome. For each point of view, I can say iPhone is the best. You can blindly go for it."

Ananth Machiraju,The iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones...!,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 July 2022,"We're pretty confident when we say that the iPhone 13 is the best iPhone for most people. It may look like Apple has only changed the position of one of the phone's back cameras since last year's model, but trust us when we say that there are more substantial upgrades than that. With a new display, larger battery, and better camera hardware and software, the iPhone 13 is the new benchmark for flagship phones.Once again, Apple's made the iPhone 13 far more powerful than its Android competitors thanks to its 5G-ready A15 Bionic chip. If the raw performance doesn't interest you, photographers can play with the new Photographic Style filters in the camera app, while videographers will be excited by the new Cinematic mode focus-racking ability.The regular iPhone 13 has some flaws. The charging is still relatively slow compared to some Android phones. And I don't like that only the iPhone 13 Pro models get a 120Hz display and telephoto zoom. But based on my in-depth iPhone 13 review, this new iPhone is the best phone for the money.The overall display quality continues to be stellar. When watching the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections, I was mesmerized by the neon code encircling Neo as he walked down the street, and in another scene, I could make out individual hairs on Neo’s beard as he stared up into the sun.DISPLAY1. Smaller notch makes the display a bit more immersive2. Slightly different button placement3. Pink and blue are standout colors4. New Green color launched March 2022CAMERA1. Bright and colorful images beat Samsung2. Ultra-wide camera delivers more scenes and improved Night mode3. Photographic styles give you creative controlVIDEO1. Cinematic mode automatically changes focus on subjects while adding bokeh2. Superior Dolby Vision HDR video qualityPERFORMANCE and A15 Bionic1.A15 Bionic is the fastest chip once again2. Machine learning performance notably betterBATTERY LIFE1.10 hours and 33 minutes of battery life, which is 2 hours better than the iPhone 12Software1.SharePlay lets you watch videos and listen to music with friends2. Focus cuts down on distractionsVERDICT :The iPhone 13 improves on what was already the best iPhone for most people by introducing a bunch of welcome enhancements. I especially like the longer battery life, as the iPhone 12’s endurance was underwhelming even for a 5G phone. I wouldn’t recommend that iPhone 12 owners upgrade to the new iPhone, but the iPhone 13 is worth it if you own an iPhone 11 or older device.I don’t think many people will care about the smaller notch. What truly stands out on the iPhone 13 is the camera. The low-light performance is even better now, and computational photography features like Cinematic mode and Photographic styles flex the A15 Bionic’s muscles in ways that go way beyond benchmarks.I’m also glad Apple doubled the starting storage at 128GB, as that move was overdue and puts the new iPhone on par with Android flagships. I’d like to see Apple offering faster charging next time around — be it via USB-C or MagSafe — as well as a 120Hz display.The bottom line is that the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and raises the bar for what you think a camera phone can do."

Khanbaba555,battery draining issue in my newly device,3.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 20 January 2023,Don't buy mini iPhone even regular iPhone 13 battery is so bad and its draining so fast even if your not using and its not old enough its my newly device I bought this on 19 jan 2023 today is 20 Jan 2023 I face this issue maybe my unit fault or ios 16.02 better upgrade to max models if you have enough penny otherwise don't waste it buy any android device for better specs and all the useful feature you'll get under 60k and one more thing you'll get bored in a single day if you switch Android to ios by the way its my personal opinion maybe someone has different about it thank you !!

Nehal,Just a hyped up product,3.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 20 January 2023,First and Foremost thing Camera its just okayish and Hyped one i found it to be equivalent to a 30-40 k range android phone.Battery Backup is top notchDisplay is good.IOS is really bad 😔 you can't tweak and play around like in android and you have to use itunes or a 3rd party app to just copy your files.For time being this is my review. If you are an ios user you can upgrade to it. If you are an android user there are way better options than this iphone.Just don't go with the hype and end up buying this. It's my opinion not value for money product. It's not worth it.

Koushik Karmakar,"Consistent, dependable & need more customization options",5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 14 September 2022,"Likes -1. A good display2. Great dual speaker sound quality3. It’s fast. I am using for more than a month and it never hanged.4. Updated to IOS 16 and unlike Android phones it is bug free or has very less bugs5. Long term software & security support (a very few Android phone manufacturers gives 5 years OS support with less bugs)6. Consistent camera. I would say the camera is not so hi fi but takes consistently good photos7. Apps are well optimized. Even google apps like YouTube, Maps, Gmail etc works better in IOS rather than their own proprietary OS8. Widgets in IOS 15 and 16. Android has widgets for decades now but IOS took the user experience to a whole new level.9. The new boxy design (introduced with iPhone 12) is cool and looks good.10. Network & call quality is good.11. Haptic feedback is awesome.Dislikes (Some dislikes are due to myself being an Android user for decades)1. The ugly notch. Though they made a dynamic island with iPhone 14 but lets accept the truth its still ugly compared to the hole punch2. Battery life & charging speed.3. Lack of customization. I can’t place the icons wherever i feel like on the screen.4. Lack of fingerprint scanner. Face id is good but fingerprint scanner is more practical, specially when you pay contactless5. Being an Android user I am used to with swipe from the right edge of the screen to go back. In iPhone this is not working & you need to reach out to actual back buttons of the app.6. Settings app is messy as all installed app would show up on the main page. I would say Android settings app is more sophisticated.7. Lastly the price should’ve been less. With all discounts & all it comes ~60k INR and its costly.Overall I am satisfied switching to iPhone 13 from Android (used OnePlus 6t for 3 years). Last time I switched to iPhone was with iPhone 5S and I couldn’t stay for 6 months and switched to Android again. But this time IOS is better in terms of consistency & user experience."
Sid,Excellent and smooth delivery,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 9 December 2022,"Iphone 13 we all know is a good phone. (Plenty of reviews already ) no major concerns here.Wanted to highlight the online process via this review.Was a bit skeptical to order a 60k+ item online but glad to say that overall process went smooth and super quick delivery (1 day delivery)Only con been other sites were offering more discounts, something to look into.Thumbs up from my side."

RASHMI NAYAK,Don’t think twice if you are an Apple Lover,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 June 2022,"I have been using iPhone 13 for more than a month and I must say I am so impressed and in love with it. Seamlessly fast and swift. As it is my first iPhone, it took a time to get acquainted with the iOS environment and settings.Although I charge the phone not more than 86% but it last whole day even after rigorous daily use. My screen time lasts 6-7 hours a day which includes Ms Teams call, Chatting, YouTube, Surfing random stuffs and BGMI as well.Picture quality is no doubt a killer. I have uploaded a night picture for a sample and I am just speechless. Portrait mode, Video stabilisation, Slow motion are the key feature one would like the most.Everything is awesome but It would have been really good if the price would have been under 45-50 grand bracket . Honestly, I think it is so overrated because of the Brand, public demands, lifestyle and its secured privacy settings. The repair cost is also so expensive that you would have to very careful while handling. I am living a life where my phone is more precious than my purse 🤭. “Purse jaye to jae magar phone ko kuch na ho”You can buy if your employer is paying you enough in WFH.

Waited for 5-6years to buy one for myself and it was worth waiting.Moving from Android to IOS was a big shift. Like all others had struggled 1st day but eventually you will learn everything.Phone is just awesome that to i got it for 55k with all exchange and bank offers. So i would say its worth every single penny.However, screen quality and brightness could have been better."

Souvik k.,Looks really premium and the camera is the best.,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 September 2022,"I am using this phone for the last 3 months approximately. This phone is perfect for all, whatever you need you can get from this device. Apple provide a better chip which really serve you a better performance and the camera is superb. Although the battery is improved in 13 series so guys you can experience this and all over a day u can easily get around 7-8hrs of backup. Build quality is superb. The thing which may be better in this is phone is that the refresh rate, Apple should give atleast 120hz but guys u if ur going to shift From 120hz display phone then only can u feel it, rest of them who are shifting from a normal smartphone u cannot analayze the refresh rate. And guys i love the notch so sorry about it 😂 i can't comment on this. Thanks"

AshIsh Sogun,iPhone 13? The sweet spot!,3.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 August 2022,"The iPhone 13 both giveth and taketh what the iPhone 12 gave it to work with. Yes the battery, camera, and storage is way better. That much is true. But the build quality? It's hit and miss. Reception Is meh but that could be the SIM card. I've had budget android phones that get full LTE reception where my 13 will have one bar. But again that could just be my SIM card on it's way out. Something about certain aspects of the phone feel much cheaper than bits of it's predecessor. For example the rear glass. Yes it's supposedly the same ceramic shield from the 12 but I've found it scratches much easier for no real reason. Another example is the speaker grille in the front notch. It looks alot cheaper and sounds that way too than the one in the 12. Pretty tinny and just rattley sounding. It's not a horrible phone. It's the first iPhone I've felt like I can get android style utility from. But the questionable build quality changes over the previous generation just stifle it for no reason. That's not to say the phone is entirely built out of meh. For example the camera lenses and the bump are much bigger on the new 13. I work as a mechanic and subjected my old 12 to the same rigors. The 12 took it like a champ aside from very light camera lenses scratching. I've subjected the 13 to much more stress and it just shrugs it off aside from the seemingly unexplainable rear glass scratches. I haven't dropped it like my 12 yet so theres always that. But if it's anything like the 12 it'll take a few hip height falls onto concrete with no issue. I'd be so bold as to call this the ""sweet spot"" for the whole iPhone lineage. good focus on where it matters. Very few compromises."

ansuman panda,Bitter sweet love,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 23 June 2022,"So when you buy the first apple iphone, after using samsung for quite a long time, the expectations are a bit on the higher side. But there are certain short comings. My brief idea after using an iPhone 13 for 1 monthPros1- the screen is amazing, no doubt about it. The pictures are crisp and viewing angles are good as well2- the battery backup is good and if compared to a samsung s20+ it's ground breaking.3- sound on this tiny bit of equipment is so loud and clear.The bitter sweetness: the much touted camera is good but if compared to the same phone bought from a brick and mortar shop, the difference is staggering. The camera seems to be off and dull.Cons: even the battery is small, the charging still takes a lot of time."

Krishnanshu Dey,iphone 13 review,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 29 July 2022,This is my first iphone that I got for 64k.Delivery boy was denying for open box after listening it's the packaging of iphone. Anyway tnx god I got it in the box. Packaging was good and intact and eco friendly.I am giving this review after one week.1. Battery backup is well optimized.2. Display is best oled with smooth experience without no lagging.3. Sound quality is awesome best ever experience with Dolby Atmos inbuild.4. LIMITLESS processor with A15 bionic chief. I sware you will get best ever gaming with highst graphics settings. Even not at all heating issue.5. In camera I like it's software experiences. I like it's night mode and cinematic mode.6. Battery backup is great and Charing is super fast with 20W charger get 80% in just 20 minutes.Only the bad thing is that no charger including in the box. Hope apple will look into this and add it in future.Last of all THANKS AMAZON FOR such great experience.
Noel,It's a premium for the right reasons,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 May 2022,"Let's start with the negative feedback here on Amazon. Some people are really derogatory with their reviews with respect to the phone, Ignore it!If you are interested in the iPhone then you know what you are getting into.It has its share of cons, one being that Whatsapp chat transfer from Android to iOS is not available at the moment, partly blame meta for the way they handle our data.Keeping that aside, you're paying for a phone that will last you more years if taken care of well, the camera may not be the best in the market but does amazingly good across all modes, be it portrait or night mode or videos, btw the cinematic mode is Kickass!!You are paying for security, the Ecosystem is really an underrated feature, the hardware is directly tied with how the OS works and the A15 is a powerful chip. The phone lasts a day.Yes, there is no charger in the box and I wish the connector was type-c.Hopefully, this helps. Will update the review with pictures soon."

Amazon Customer,Very Bad Software Experience,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 12 August 2022,"Guys, the software experience is very bad for me as I switched from Stock Android. Please don’t buy just because of the brand, instead lend an iphone from your friend or relative and use for 2 weeks and you will understand there are lots of differences between Android and IOS. After this if you still like the Iphone then you can buy it."
Bibhas,Best value for money iphone 13,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 5 October 2022,"This is my first iphone and the experience is just amazing and i am also using an android phone but the animation, UI, camera quality, battery life is awesome in apple devices. Also the charger is only 20w but it’s charged very fast you will not feel like it’s a slow charger. :)"
Puneet Sahoo,Excellent!,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 August 2022,"Switched from Android to IOS for the first time and I don’t regret it one bit. The UI is buttery smooth, apps never glitch and the camera is top notch. People who love to customise their phones may not like it since iOS doesn’t provide that flexibility, but for me its not a problem.If I had to nitpick, the only thing I don’t like is the cinematic mode. Its a good attempt, but it’s nowhere near perfect, which is understandable since its a new feature.Go for this phone, you’ll love it!"

Manasa,Camera rocks,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 3 August 2022,Camera is definitely a plus but not exactly a slr replacement. Android users may find the security annoying..I did....biggest constraints is u cant cpy the pictures and videos directly from iphone to laptop unless u hav mac book. Audio(Stereo )quality is awesome for a phone. Battery will last 1 day for average users .....jumping lot of hoops for simple tasks (on Android) is a bummer....but security is security 🤣.No 4k for cinematic ....

Now it’s been like nearly six months I been using this phone and I couldn’t really find a real drawback what do ever.Camera is the best. I am not exaggerating, it is better than the entry level DSLR’s. Performance, battery life, sound, display - I am so impressed.The only drawback I could see is phone is slightly heating up while playing games or charging.But it’s still worth a buy."

Suresh Chandra Sahu,I mean it’s THE iPhone what would you expect!,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 1 May 2022,"A fabulous phone with the perfect size.A smartphone have mostly 5 major categories in which it shows up its real value.Cameras, Processor, Battery, Display and durability.Cameras - 4/5 These are one of the best if not the best camera in a mobile device till Now!(except zoom)Processor - 10/5it’s A15 Bionic (Name is enough)Snapdragon will take 2 years to even come close this powerhouse beast.Battery life - 5/5. On my usage my iPhone yielded 9 - 10 hrs screen on time.(Remember it’s not the highest mah cell it’s super efficient)Display - 3/5 absolutely a shameful and greedy act by Apple in terms of display department it’s 2022 and in this year even 10k phones provide 120hz display and here comes Apple saving the 120hz displays for the pro models only.(Note it’s probably the smoothest and the best 60hz panel)Durability - 5/5 can easily last 3 years without any problem and after that just change the battery and it’s good for 3 more years + the resell value of iPhone’s are also best.There are other minor factors like the Apple ecosystem, the Build Quality, the service, the secured ui, and a lot lot more.A very happy owner."

Kishpalap,iPhone 13 strains your eye for websites which require scrolling.,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 28 April 2022,Using I phone 13 for past few days.My honest reviewPros:Battery back up is good and improved.you could get easily for a compete day with moderate usageScreen quality is good and comparable to Super AMOLED display.Cons:Screen refresh rate is very low may be @ 60 hz which will strain your eye while scrolling on the web pages and apps which is not good from the price point.Even basic android mobiles will give this and this is not at all acceptable for an iPhone which is major con.Charger is not given in the box and need to be purchased additionally which is also not good at this price point.At least Charger and branded ear pieces have to be given along with box pack.Apple has to improve in these areas.
Harisha Kumar K,iPhone Can be defective!,4.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 17 May 2022,"This is the second time I am buying an iPhone from Amazon. Received the phone in good condition. Used for half an hour and the phone downloaded 15.4.1 update and started rebooting. But it never rebooted instead stuck in boot loop. I contacted Amazon they suggested to visit apple service Center. Apple products don’t come with replacement, if anything goes bad you have to visit apple care. I visited apple care which is at 70km from my place and they took my phone for service. After three days they provided a new iPhone with replacement letter containing old to new serial no and imei no. So everything ended happily. If your place is very far from apple care then you will be in trouble in such situations."

Abijith,Good Allrounder,5.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 8 May 2022,What are the main things that you want in a phone1: Processor A15 bionic fastest chipset for a mobile phone till date2: Display Super Retina display looks just awesome and the notch becomes almost invisible while you are viewing content with black background. Supports Uhd in prime video. Also supports Dolby vision.3: Speakers supports Dolby atmos. It is loud and clear.4: Battery the best battery ever in an iPhone it lasts easily for over a day of heavy usage with almost 7hrs of screen on time.5: Cameras as usual top notch from apple but missing telephoto lens when you try to Zoom and take pictures.6: Protection comes with ceramic shield at the front the strongest phone display till date.It is the best value for money smartphone from apple. There are very few things missing like the telephoto lens for which you need to upgrade to 13 pro.overall review a beast which covers all the areas perfectly.Just buy it if you can afford it and the pricing nowadays is around 70k which makes this a great package.

Rahul Singh,Either i recieved defective piece or iphone series is crap,3.0,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 11 June 2022,"Hi, I was android user for tha last 7 years. I decided to switch to IOS finally.First of all 128gb variant was out of stock, so had to buy the 256 gb variant. I have used it for few months, and i have mixed opinions. I will list the cons and pros:-Pros-1) Battery life is awesome. Easily goes a day without charging twice with good amount of social media usages.2) Really smooth UI experience. Feels like 90 fps.3) Display is top notch. Though the screen size could have been bigger.4)Charging is fast as compared to other 20W charging phones.5) Good face unlock feature.6) Great picture quality tho there are some problems i have discussed in cons.6) feels and looks premiumCons:-1) Not android friendly. If u are switching from android, u will find it very difficult to use.2) Sells by the name of privacy, but no privacy features like app lock, lock during calls is available.3) Few apps stop working very often. This maybe just with my device as i have doubts that i have recieved a defective device.4) Slo mo videos lags and skip frames on my device. Will get it check by service center.5)No c type support6) Notification management is very poor.7) lack of fingerprint scanner( only android users)8)file system is very bad . They say that it is so to secure the privacy. But it really sucks.So, if u can go with the cons listed above u can consider it to buy. I will recommend continue to stick to android. For less price you can get a better deal."
